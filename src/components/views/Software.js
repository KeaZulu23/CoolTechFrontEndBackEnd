      <p/>While many professionals swear by Adobe’s photo editing tools, others find it a bit overkill, 
      either in terms of usability and interface or price. Ever since Adobe moved to a subscription model, 
      it can cost between R150 and R400 per month to use Photoshop or Adobe's other photo editing apps. And 
      like other subscription services, you don’t get to keep the software, so if you want to edit a .PSD you 
      created after your subscription ends, you’ll have to re-up. <br/><br/> Suffice to say, Adobe's tactics have left 
      some looking for an alternative, and we have a pretty thorough list to check out. Some are free, others are 
      online-only, there are some multiplatform choices and platform exclusive options as well, so take a read-through 
      and try some of these useful photo editing tools.<p/><br/><br/>

          <p/>Krita is an open-source application ideal for content creation, illustrations, painting, sketching, comic books, 
          concept art and more. Available on Mac, Windows and Linux, Krita has a ton of features that should appeal to pros, 
          like brush stabilization, extensive brush customization, HDR painting and animation. <br/><br/> Frequently updated, 
          Krita supports multiple monitors and tablet inputs. The app has recently been offered on the Epic Games Store too, 
          increasing its audience. It's also stable enough for prolonged use. Many users install Krita alongside GIMP to provide 
          a powerful but free suite of software that covers all their image editing and creation needs.

          <p/>Darktable is a suitable option for those looking to edit and export RAW files. 
          Like GIMP, it’s free, but it’s not as powerful. Darktable is more of a Lightroom competitor as it focuses 
          on non-destructive editing over other photo manipulation, but for many photographers, it may do the trick. <br/><br/>
          There's also a great photo organization tool included in Darktable. The RAW photo processing is robust, 
          and there are lots of controls to adjust photos, but there are some complaints about the stability and speed of the program. 
          Some may be able to overlook those issues considering the price tag.

          <p/>A lightweight online photo editor that may be better suited for those on devices with limited storage. 
          PhotoPea runs completely in your browser, and according to the documentation, doesn’t upload anything so you can load Photopea.com, 
          disconnect from the internet and keep using it offline. <br/><br/>
          Photopea is great at resizing images and adjusting colors, but can also be used to work with vector graphics, 
          creating illustrations, and more. It has support for most graphic formats including PSDs which is extra handy. 
          Those used to Photoshop should find themselves in familiar territory with Photopea, as it supports layers, masks, 
          brush tools, guides, scripts, and even animation tools. While a premium account is offered, it just removes ads and 
          increases the history steps to 60 rather than 30 in the free version. Critically, PhotoPea isn't the most stable and 
          can take a while to process some actions.
