    <p>As an occasional personal blogger, I have seen a lot of other folks in the blogosphere who just want to write personal publications that are not exactly meant for making money. 
    I really like that, actually. We need more people who just want to share their stories in this world. The best tip I can give you is that you should be you when writing your blog. 
    Let your voice (not your proficiency in the English language) shine through when writing. Does that mean you can break some grammar rules? You bet it does. Enjoy that. 
    However, with your voice, you shouldn't pretend to be someone you're not. When you blog, you're basically letting people take a step into your mind. Sure, it's okay to clean the place up a little bit. 
    However, don't entirely remodel your brain's interior just for them. Be who you are when writing.
